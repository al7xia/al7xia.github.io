## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

* Lab 3 Part 2

    Lab 3 in general was the most fun lab to do because of how interesting it was to test each of the calculators. The date difference calculator was very fun to use because I was able to put my own birthday to see how many days I’ve been alive. It was also a very tedious lab to do because we had to make sure we typed out the correct formula which was very long. In the end I learned about writing function definitions and had a lot of fun doing it. 

* Lab 4 Part 2

    This was my favorite lab because we learned how to use if statements, and I was able to play the secret number game with my partner. Because it was pretty fun to test, we ended up playing it a few more times. This lab also was great practice to see the difference between assigning and comparing. 

* Lab 6 Part 2

    This was an interesting lab to do because I was already familiar with the game Blackjack. It was pretty fun to code as well because of how many functions we had to complete and all the if statements we used to complete them. This lab also was great practice for validating command line arguments, where if there was any argument greater than or less than 2, we would print out an error message.
